## Objective: 
To develop a dApp for secure file storage on a decentralized network. Users can upload and store files. The contract manages user access control and allows users to pay other users for access to their data using ETH.

## Functionality:

- Users can upload files to the decentralized network through the dApp.

- Users can set access permissions for their files, specifying who can view or download them.

- Users can grant access to other users for a specific duration or permanently in exchange for an ETH fee.

- The dApp facilitates secure file sharing and ensures data privacy based on access permissions.
